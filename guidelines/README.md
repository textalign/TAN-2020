In this folder, [main.xml](main.xml) is the master format for the guidelines, the basis of other formats
such as xhtml and pdf, which are not included in the Git project. For those other formats, see 
[the project website](http://textalign.net). 

Alternatively, you can generate the PDF or HTML content from within the Oxygen project. Run the transformation scenario `SETUP: convert TAN guidelines to PDF` or `SETUP: convert TAN guidelines to XHTML`.
