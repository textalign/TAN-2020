# TAN Error Suite

There are two batteries of tests.

* Under the subdirectory `errors` you will find a variety of TAN XML files. These are set up to fail everywhere possible, and are marked as valid only when every anticipated error really occurs.
* The file `TAN-function-library.xspec` is the master point of entry for XSpec tests. Only a handful of TAN functions have been assigned XSpec tests, and no templates.
