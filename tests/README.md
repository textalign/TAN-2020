# TAN Error Suite

There are two batteries of tests.

* Under the subdirectory `errors` you will find a variety of TAN XML files. These are set up to fail everywhere possible, and are marked as valid only when every anticipated error really occurs.
* XSpec files provide select tests on functions that are conducive to testing. Only a handful of TAN functions are tested, and no templates.
