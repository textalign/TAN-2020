    <!-- Welcome to Diff+, the TAN application that finds and analyzes text differences-->
    <!-- Version 2021-09-06 -->
    <!-- Take any number of versions of a text, compare them, and view and study all the text
        differences in an HTML page. The HTML output allows you to see precisely where one version
        differs from the other. A small Javascript library allows you to change focus, remove
        versions, and explore statistics that show quantitatively how close the versions are to each
        other. Parameters allow you to make normalizations before making the comparison, and to weigh
        statistics accordingly. This application has been used not only for individual comparisons,
        but for more demanding needs: to analyze changes in documents passing through a multistep
        editorial workflow, to compare the quality of OCR results, and to study the relationship
        between ancient/medieval manuscripts (stemmatology).-->

    <!-- This master stylesheet is the public interface for the application. The parameters you will most
      likely want to change are listed and documented below, to help you customize the application to suit
      your needs. If you are relatively new to XSLT, or TAN applications, see Using TAN Applications and
      Utilities in the TAN Guidelines for general instructions. If you want to avoid changing the master
      application file, use the accompanying configuration file. Or make a copy of this file and edit and
      run it directly. Or create and configure a transformation scenario in Oxygen, defining the relevant
      parameters as you like. If you are comfortable with XSLT, try creating your own stylesheet, then
      import this one, and customize the process. To access the code base, follow the link in the
      <xsl:include> at the bottom of this file. -->
    
    
    <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
    
    <!-- This is a MIRU Stylesheet (MIRU = Main Input Resolved URIs) -->
    <!-- Primary input: any XML file, including this one (input is ignored) -->
    <!-- Secondary input: one or more files -->
    <!-- Primary output: perhaps diagnostics -->
    <!-- Secondary output: for each detectable language in the secondary input: (1) an XML file with
      the results of tan:diff() or tan:collate(), infused with select statistical analyses; (2) a
      rendering of #1 in an interactive, visually engaging HTML form -->

    <!-- Nota bene: -->
    <!-- * This application is useful only if the input files have different versions of the same text 
        in the same language. -->
    <!-- * The XML output is a straightforward result of tan:diff() or tan:collate(), perhaps wrapped by
        an element that also includes prepended statistical analysis. --> 
    <!-- * The HTML output has been designed to work with specific JavaScript and CSS files, and the HTML 
        output will not render correctly unless you have set up dependencies correctly. Currently, the 
        HTML output is directed to the TAN output subdirectory, with the HTML pointing to the appropriate
        javascript and CSS files in the js and css directories. -->
    
    <!-- WARNING: CERTAIN FEATURES HAVE YET TO BE IMPLEMENTED-->
    <!-- * Revise process that reinfuses a class 1 file with a diff/collate into a standard extra
        TAN function.
        * Add parameter to allow serialization of input XML, for closer comparison of XML structures.
    -->
    
    <!-- This application currently just scratches the surface of what is possible. New features are
        planned! Some desiderata:
        1. Support a single TAN-A as the catalyst or MIRU provider, allowing <alias> to define the groups.
        2. Support MIRUs that point to non-TAN files, e.g., plain text, docx, xml.
        3. Allow one to decide whether Venn diagrams should adjust the common area or not.
        4. Enhance options on statistics.
    -->

    <!-- PARAMETERS -->
    <!-- Many parameters relevant to this application are to be found at:
        ../../parameters/params-application.xsl
        ../../parameters/params-application-diff.xsl
        ../../parameters/params-application-language.xsl
        Any parameter in this file that begins "tan:" has a corresponding parameter in one of the
      files above, and will overwrite the default value given there. You might want to alter other
      parameters in the files above for this application. All you need to do is paste a copy of the
      element in this file, replacing the value with the one you prefer. The local parameter will
      overwrite the general one. For example, if you want differences between two texts to be
      letter-for-letter, not word-for-word, then paste the following into this file: <xsl:param
      name="tan:snap-to-word" as="xs:boolean" select="false()"/> Study the parameters to see what options
      are available.
 -->


    <!-- STEP ONE: PICK YOUR DIRECTORIES AND FILES -->

    <!-- What directories of interest hold the target files? The following parameters are provided as examples,
      and for convenince, in case you want to have several commonly used directories handy. See below for
      the main parameter to pick via variable name the directory or directories you want. -->
    <xsl:param name="directory-1-uri" select="'../../examples'" as="xs:string?"/>
    <xsl:param name="directory-2-uri" select="'../../../library-arithmeticus/evagrius/cpg2455'" as="xs:string?"/>

    <xsl:param name="directory-5-uri" select="'../../../library-arithmeticus/test/ring2'" as="xs:string?"/>
    
    <!-- What directory or directories has the main input files? Any relative path will be calculated
      against the location of this application file. Multiple directories may be supplied. Too many files?
      Results can be filtered below. -->
    <xsl:param name="tan:main-input-relative-uri-directories" as="xs:string+" select="$directory-5-uri"/>

    <!-- What pattern must each filename match (a regular expression, case-insensitive)? Of the files 
        in the directories chosen, only those whose names match this pattern will be included. A null 
        or empty string means ignore this parameter. -->
    <xsl:param name="tan:input-filenames-must-match-regex" as="xs:string?" select="''"/>

    <!-- What pattern must each filename NOT match (a regular expression, case-insensitive)? Of the files 
        in the directories chosen, any whose names match this pattern will be excluded. A null 
        or empty string means ignore this parameter. -->
    <xsl:param name="tan:input-filenames-must-not-match-regex" as="xs:string?" select="''"/>
    


    <!-- STEP TWO: REFINE INPUT FILES -->
    
    <!-- Adjust class 1 files -->
    <!-- If you have pointed to TAN class 1 files, you can do quite a lot of adjustments ahead of time, to 
    refine your results, and create natural groups. -->

    <!-- In a given group of collations/diffs, should input be restricted to only top-level 
        divs whose @ns match? Note, this will automatically remove any input that is not a

    -->
    <xsl:param name="restrict-to-matching-top-level-div-attr-ns" as="xs:boolean" select="false()"/>
    
    <!-- What language should be assumed for any input text that does not have a language associated with it?
      Please use a standard 3-letter ISO code, e.g., eng for English, grc for ancient Greek, deu for
      German, etc. -->
    <xsl:param name="default-language" as="xs:string?" select="'eng'"/>

      output will show the normalized results, and statistics will be based on it. But when building the
      HTML output, this application will try to reinject the original text into the adjusted difference.
      This is oftentimes an imperfect process, because any restoration must broker between differences
      across versions. In general, the first version will predominate. -->
    
    
    <!-- ~ ~ ~ All languages in general -->
    
    <!-- Should <div> @ns be injected into the text? Normally you do not want to do this, but it can be
